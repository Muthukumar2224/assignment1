    <p class="para"> What are pasta chips?
        <br>Pasta chips are golden brown “chips” that are basically deep fried pasta. You can make them in the air fryer which makes them a perfect, quick snack when you’re looking for something warm and crunchy. Any type of pasta works but larger shapes that you can pick up and dip are the best.
        Even though pasta chips are trending right now, they’re actually kind of an established snack. Crispy crunchy pasta chips have been on the internet at least since 2013</p>
    <p class="para2"> How to make pasta chips?
<br><ol>Cook the pasta in salted water according to package instructions given below
    <li>Drain well and  Toss.</li>
    <li>Add some oil and seasoning to the pasta and toss well, making sure every piece of pasta is coated.</li>
        <li>Air fry. Working in batches, add the pasta to a lightly oiled air fryer basket and air fry on 400°F for 10-12 minutes. </li>
            <li>shaking the pan or stirring occasionally, until the pasta is golden brown and crisp.</li>
